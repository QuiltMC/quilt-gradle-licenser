# Quilt Licenser Gradle Plugin

A license header manager for Gradle.

Its goal is to ensure that the source files contains a predefined license header determined by some rules, and optionally generate them automatically with a Gradle task.

## Usage

For a project you need to apply the plugin to your project:

```groovy
plugins {
	id 'org.quiltmc.gradle.licenser' version '1.1.+'
}
```

The following mavens also need to be added to your `settings.gradle` for resolution:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
		maven {
			name 'Quilt'
			url 'https://maven.quiltmc.org/repository/release'
		}
	}
}
```

### Tasks

| Name            | Description                                                 |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `applyLicenses` | Updates the license headers in the selected source files.   |
| `checkLicenses` | Verifies the license headers for the selected source files. |

### Configuration

The plugin can be configured using the `license` extension on the project.

```groovy
license {
	// Add a license header rule, at least one must be present.
	rule file("codeformat/HEADER")

	// Exclude/include certain file types: (Default: Excludes files without standard comment format and binary files)
	include '**/*.java' // Apply license header ONLY to Java files
	// OR
	exclude '**/*.properties' // Apply license header NOT to properties files
}
```

More configuration options may come in the future.

### License header rule

The way this plugin works is a license header have multiple header rules.
This allows to select and apply specific headers for some files.

An example file can be found in this repository: [`codeformat/HEADER`](./codeformat/HEADER).

#### Format

A license header rule contains the license header text, and metadata prefixed with `;;`.
License header text can contain variables formatted as the following `${VARIABLE}`.

This would give a file:
```
License text ${YEAR}

;;metadata: hello
;;more metadata: hi!
;;key: value
```

##### Variables

Currently, only the `${YEAR}` variable is available.

##### Metadata

 - `match_from`  
   No default value.  
   Regular expressions the file can match against to select this header rule.
   Each declaration of `match_from` is added to the global regex with an OR relation.
   The regular expression only match against the beginning of the file.
 - `year_display`  
   Default value: `latest_only`  
   Describes how the year variable should look like.  
   Available values are:
   - `latest_only` for only the last modification year,
   - `list` for a list of years,
   - `lenient_range` for a range between the absolute minimum year and last modification year
 - `year_selection`  
   Default value: `project`  
   Describes how the modification year should be fetched,
   Git commits are used to determine the last modification year.  
   Available values are:
   - `project` for which the project is used as reference,
   - `file` for which each file can have its own last modification year
